/**
 * AgenticMail → Claude Code event dispatcher.
 *
 * Long-lived daemon that bridges AgenticMail's event stream to the
 * Claude Agent SDK. Concretely: subscribes to the master API's SSE
 * stream for every AgenticMail account, and when an event arrives —
 * either a new mail in some agent's inbox, or a task assigned to some
 * agent — it spawns a Claude-powered worker that *is* that agent (same
 * persona, same `_account`-scoped MCP toolbelt) and lets it handle the
 * trigger.
 *
 * This is what makes "send an email to fola@localhost and she wakes up
 * and replies" work — without any always-on enterprise runtime, and
 * without an interactive Claude Code session having to be open.
 *
 * # Design notes
 *
 *   - One SSE connection per account (the master API does not currently
 *     expose a master-key "watch everything" endpoint). The dispatcher
 *     polls `GET /accounts` every `accountSyncIntervalMs` to discover
 *     newly-created accounts and tear down ones that disappeared, so
 *     `create_account` is wake-able within ~one sync interval with zero
 *     manual steps.
 *
 *   - Workers are spawned via `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`'s
 *     `query()` — same OAuth as the user's `claude`, same MCP server,
 *     same persona prompt as the on-disk `.md`. Each worker drains its
 *     query stream to completion, then exits.
 *
 *   - Concurrency is capped via a small semaphore (default 10). Beyond
 *     that, wakes queue. This is a hard floor on Anthropic-side cost:
 *     50 simultaneous wakes = 50 simultaneous Claude calls, which the
 *     user is unlikely to want by default.
 *
 *   - Task events get an explicit "claim + submit_result" instruction
 *     in the wake prompt so the call_agent long-poll on the master API
 *     resolves cleanly. Mail events just say "you've got new mail" and
 *     trust the persona to do the right thing (read / reply / archive).

/**
 * Wake-budget circuit breaker.

 * # The failure modes we're guarding against
 *
 * Three real concerns from production multi-agent coordination:
 *
 *   1. **Reply loops.** Agent A replies-all → agents B/C/D wake → one
 *      of them replies-all → A wakes again on its own thread → ad
 *      infinitum. Without a brake this burns tokens forever.
 *
 *   2. **Storms.** 10 agents CC'd on the same thread = every reply
 *      wakes 9 workers. Most "stay silent" but each still costs one
 *      Claude turn. We let this work naturally up to a point, but
 *      cap the absolute number per (agent, thread).
 *
 *   3. **Stuck agents.** One agent keeps replying without progress.
 *      Per-(agent, thread) cap catches this even if the persona-level
 *      "stay silent unless it's your turn" rule fails.
 *
 * # Design
 *
 * One entry per (account.id, threadId) tuple. Each entry tracks how
 * many times we've spawned a worker for that combination, plus the
 * timestamp of the first wake in the current window. When the count
 * hits `maxWakesPerThread`, further wakes for that pair are dropped
 * with a log line — until the window expires and the entry resets.
 *
 * The window is wall-clock-relative (not sliding) which is the cheap-
 * and-good-enough trade-off: a thread that maxes out at minute 0 of a
 * 24h window stays muted for the full 24h. That's the right behaviour
 * — if a thread is generating runaway wakes, we WANT it muted for a
 * long time, not for the agent to be re-wakeable as soon as its 24h
 * window slides past oldest entry.
 *
 * The store is bounded by periodic GC (every wake we sweep entries
 * older than the window). Set growth is therefore proportional to
 * unique active threads in the window, not total history.
