/**
 * AgenticMail Claude Code mail hook.
 *
 * # What this script is
 *
 * A Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` hook. It runs every time the user
 * sends a prompt in the Claude Code interactive UI, BEFORE Claude
 * sees the prompt. The hook checks the AgenticMail bridge inbox
 * (`claudecode@localhost`) for new mail that arrived since the last
 * hook run, and if it finds any, injects a summary as additional
 * context so Claude becomes aware of it without the user having to
 * ask "any updates?"
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * Claude Code is a synchronous REPL — there is no out-of-band channel
 * that lets external services push notifications to a running session.
 * When AgenticMail sub-agents reply to a coordination thread (or ask
 * the host a mid-task question), the reply lands in the bridge inbox
 * but Claude doesn't know about it until either:
 *
 *   (a) Claude proactively polls `list_inbox` / `wait_for_email`, OR
 *   (b) the user explicitly says "check on the team"
 *
 * That latency makes async multi-agent coordination feel half-built.
 * This hook closes the gap. The user types ANY prompt — even
 * "thanks", "what time is it", anything — and Claude transparently
 * gets "by the way, Vesper sent you a question 30 seconds ago" in
 * the system context. Claude can decide to surface it, act on it,
 * or store it for later.
 *
 * # Two event types, two output schemas
 *
 *   - UserPromptSubmit — fires when the user types. Output uses
 *     `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` to inject a system-style
 *     message before Claude reasons about the prompt.
 *
 *   - Stop — fires when Claude was about to stop a turn. THIS is the
 *     autonomous-mode awareness mechanism. If new mail arrived during
 *     a long autonomous run (Claude Code running headless for hours
 *     with no user prompts), Stop fires when Claude is about to stop
 *     and we return `{decision: 'block', reason: '...'}`. Claude is
 *     forced to continue, sees the reason as context, and can read
 *     and respond to the mail before finally stopping.
 *
 *     This is the proper fix for the autonomous-mode case we filed
 *     as a follow-up in 0.8.23. Unlike PreToolUse (whose schema
 *     does not accept additionalContext, hence the noisy error
 *     spam in 0.8.22), the Stop hook's `decision: 'block'` is the
 *     supported supported way to inject context at turn boundaries
 *     without firing on every single tool call.
 *
 * # Design constraints
 *
 *   - Must be FAST: this runs on every prompt; >500ms perceived latency
 *     would be a tax on every interaction. We use 2s HTTP timeouts and
 *     bail silently on any error so user prompts never block.
 *
 *   - Must be SILENT on failure: AgenticMail might not be running,
 *     master key might be missing, network might be down. None of
 *     those are reasons to make a regular Claude Code prompt fail.
 *     `process.exit(0)` with no output = no context injection.
 *
 *   - Must DEDUP: we don't want to re-tell Claude about the same
 *     email on every turn. We persist a cursor (timestamp of the
 *     latest mail we surfaced) in `~/.agenticmail/claudecode-hook-cursor.json`
 *     and only surface mail received after it.
 *
 * # Output format
 *
 * Claude Code's `UserPromptSubmit` hook accepts a JSON response with
 * `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. That string gets prepended
 * to the user's prompt as a system-style message so Claude sees it
 * before reasoning about the user's request.
 *
 * We deliberately keep the injected context terse — one line per new
 * mail (UID, sender, subject, ~120 char preview). The full email is
 * one `read_email` call away if Claude wants more.

/**
 * One-shot capabilities preamble injected on the FIRST UserPromptSubmit

 *
 * Why this exists
 * ───────────────
 * Claude Code sessions start with no prior knowledge of which MCP tools
 * are wired up. The model can SEE the tools (they appear in its
 * tool-use schema), but a tool name + zod schema is a thin signal —
 * the model doesn't know when AgenticMail is the right reach for a
 * problem. So when the user asks "build me a flashcard app", Claude
 * often goes straight to single-process scaffolding when AgenticMail
 * would unlock multi-agent design/build/review in parallel.
 *
 * This blurb tells the model:
 *   - what AgenticMail is for in plain language
 *   - the specific patterns it should reach for it (multi-agent
 *     coordination, durable email threads, sub-agent spawning)
 *   - the THREE high-leverage tools (send_email, create_account,
 *     call_agent) — not the full 60+, which would just be noise
 *
 * Kept short: ~250 tokens. Long enough to shape behaviour, short
 * enough that on a 30-prompt session it's <1% of total tokens.
