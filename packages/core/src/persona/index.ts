/**
 * Agent persona system — the "soul file" for each AgenticMail agent.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *
 *   Before this module, when you asked an AgenticMail agent on a phone
 *   call "who are you?" they answered "I'm an assistant" — generic,
 *   identity-less, embarrassing. The realtime bridge had a single
 *   hardcoded DEFAULT_PERSONA string that said exactly that. Worse,
 *   the same agent talking to you over Telegram and the same agent
 *   answering an email had three completely uncoupled personalities.
 *
 *   The persona system gives every agent ONE durable identity file
 *   (~/.agenticmail/agents/<name>/persona.md) that the voice runtime,
 *   the Telegram bridge, the email worker, and any future spawn path
 *   ALL load before composing their prompts. Same agent, same person,
 *   across every channel.
 *
 * What's stored, what isn't:
 *
 *   The persona file holds the STATIC core identity — the agent's
 *   name, values, communication style, voice. Things that don't
 *   change call-to-call. EVOLVING knowledge (preferences, lessons
 *   learned, relationships, facts) lives in the existing agent memory
 *   system (`AgentMemoryManager.generateMemoryContext()`), which is
 *   loaded ALONGSIDE the persona at call time. The two complement
 *   each other: persona is "who you are", memory is "what you know".
 *
 * Discovery + edits:
 *
 *   - First read for a given agent name auto-creates the file with
 *     {@link buildDefaultPersona} content seeded with the name.
 *   - Operators can edit the file directly (it's a plain markdown
 *     file under their own ~/.agenticmail/) or via the
 *     `agenticmail persona [--agent <name>]` CLI command.
 *   - The file lives outside the encrypted-config envelope on
 *     purpose: it's not a secret, and the operator should be able
 *     to read, grep, version-control, and revise it freely.
