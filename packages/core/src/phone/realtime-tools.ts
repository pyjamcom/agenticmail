/**
 * Realtime voice tools — the tool-using layer on top of the v0.9.52
 * audio bridge (see `realtime-bridge.ts`).
 *
 * # What this file is
 *
 * v0.9.52 wired a 46elks ⇄ OpenAI Realtime audio bridge that could only
 * *converse*. v0.9.53 turns the voice agent into something that can
 * *act* on a live call: ask the human operator a question, look things
 * up, tell the time. The enabler is OpenAI Realtime **function
 * calling** — tools declared in `session.tools`, called by the model
 * mid-call, dispatched here, and answered back over the wire.
 *
 * This module is the transport-agnostic half of that:
 *   - {@link RealtimeToolDefinition} — the JSON-schema tool shapes the
 *     bridge declares to OpenAI.
 *   - {@link ToolExecutor} — the interface the bridge dispatches calls
 *     into; {@link createToolExecutor} builds one from a handler map.
 *   - The *pure / fast* tool implementations ({@link getDatetime},
 *     {@link recallMemory}, {@link webSearch}) — no sockets, no DB
 *     handles passed in directly, fully unit-testable.
 *   - {@link pollForOperatorAnswer} — the poll loop `ask_operator` uses
 *     to block (with an injectable clock + sleep) until the operator
 *     answers or the hard timeout elapses.
 *   - {@link parseOperatorQueryReply} — parses an operator's *email*
 *     reply back into a query answer (the channel-agnostic default
 *     notifier path, see the plan §5).
 *
 * The *side-effecting* wiring — actually recording an operator query on
 * a mission, sending the notification email, calling a web-search API —
 * lives in `@agenticmail/api`'s `realtime-ws.ts`, which builds a
 * {@link ToolExecutor} per connection. Keeping that split means
 * `@agenticmail/core` stays dependency-light and every piece here is
 * testable with fakes.
 *
 * > NOTE on OpenAI Realtime GA event/field names: the function-calling
 * > wire shapes (`session.tools`, `tool_choice`, `function_call_output`,
 * > `response.function_call_arguments.done`) follow the plan. Any name
 * > that could not be verified against the v0.9.52 code is flagged with
 * > a comment in `realtime-bridge.ts` — verify against current OpenAI
 * > docs before the live smoke test (same discipline as v0.9.52's
 * > `response.output_audio.delta` vs legacy `response.audio.delta`).

 * only 46elks ever sees). So an emailed answer is accepted ONLY when its
 * `From` address matches the configured operator address (case-
 * insensitive, address-only).
 *
 * Returns `false` when no `operatorEmail` is configured — no operator
 * means nobody is trusted (fail closed), so the email-reply path is
 * simply inert on a deployment without one.
 *
 * NOTE: ultimate strength still depends on inbound SPF/DKIM rejecting a
 * spoofed `From`; this check closes the casual-leak path — a leaked or
 * forwarded subject token replied to from an arbitrary address.
