/**
 * Realtime voice bridge — wires the OpenAI Realtime API to a phone
 * carrier's realtime-media WebSocket so a phone mission can actually
 * *converse*.
 *
 * # Shape of the integration
 *
 *   caller  ⇄  carrier  ⇄  (carrier media WebSocket)  ⇄  AgenticMail
 *                                                         │
 *                                          RealtimeVoiceBridge
 *                                                         │
 *                                      (OpenAI Realtime WebSocket)
 *                                                         │
 *                                                   gpt-realtime
 *
 * The carrier streams the live call audio to AgenticMail as JSON frames
 * (base64 audio); AgenticMail relays them to OpenAI as
 * `input_audio_buffer.append`; OpenAI streams synthesised speech back
 * as `response.output_audio.delta`; AgenticMail relays that to the
 * carrier. Server-side VAD on the OpenAI session handles turn-taking —
 * no manual commit / response.create.
 *
 * # Provider-pluggable transport
 *
 * The carrier side speaks a provider-specific wire protocol — 46elks
 * (`hello`/`audio`/`bye`, linear PCM) and Twilio Media Streams
 * (`connected`/`start`/`media`/`stop`, G.711 µ-law). Those differences
 * are isolated behind a {@link RealtimeTransportAdapter}: the bridge
 * itself — OpenAI session lifecycle, function calling, barge-in,
 * transcript, teardown — is identical across providers and lives here
 * once. The bridge defaults to the 46elks adapter, so existing callers
 * that pass no `transport` keep their exact prior behaviour.
 *
 * # Memory injection — the whole point
 *
 * Before the OpenAI session starts, the agent's persistent memory is
 * rendered (`AgentMemoryManager.generateMemoryContext()`) and folded
 * into the Realtime session `instructions`. The model is told to treat
 * that block as *its own* long-term knowledge — so on the call it acts
 * with full continuity, as if it had always known those things.
 *
 * # Why this file is transport-agnostic
 *
 * `RealtimeVoiceBridge` never touches a socket. It takes two abstract
 * {@link RealtimeBridgePort}s (one per side) and is driven by
 * `handle*Message` / `handle*Open` / `handle*Close` calls. The real
 * WebSocket plumbing lives in `@agenticmail/api` (which has the `ws`
 * dependency); tests drive the bridge with in-memory fake ports. This
 * keeps `@agenticmail/core` dependency-free and the bridge logic fully
 * unit-testable without a live OpenAI key or a carrier websocket number.
 *
 * The exact OpenAI Realtime wire shapes below are the GA `gpt-realtime`
 * protocol (session config nested under `audio.input` / `audio.output`,
 * `format` as an object, `response.output_audio.delta` for output). The
 * legacy beta output event name `response.audio.delta` is also handled
 * defensively — some `gpt-realtime` deployments still emit it.
