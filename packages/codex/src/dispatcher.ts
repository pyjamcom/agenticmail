/**
 * AgenticMail → Claude Code event dispatcher.
 *
 * Long-lived daemon that bridges AgenticMail's event stream to the
 * Claude Agent SDK. Concretely: subscribes to the master API's SSE
 * stream for every AgenticMail account, and when an event arrives —
 * either a new mail in some agent's inbox, or a task assigned to some
 * agent — it spawns a Claude-powered worker that *is* that agent (same
 * persona, same `_account`-scoped MCP toolbelt) and lets it handle the
 * trigger.
 *
 * This is what makes "send an email to fola@localhost and she wakes up
 * and replies" work — without any always-on enterprise runtime, and
 * without an interactive Claude Code session having to be open.
 *
 * # Design notes
 *
 *   - One SSE connection per account (the master API does not currently
 *     expose a master-key "watch everything" endpoint). The dispatcher
 *     polls `GET /accounts` every `accountSyncIntervalMs` to discover
 *     newly-created accounts and tear down ones that disappeared, so
 *     `create_account` is wake-able within ~one sync interval with zero
 *     manual steps.
 *
 *   - Workers are spawned via `@openai/codex-sdk`'s `Thread.runStreamed()`
 *     — same OpenAI auth as the user's `codex`, same MCP server, same
 *     persona prompt as the on-disk `.toml`. Each worker drains its event
 *     stream to completion, then exits. Codex emits a different event shape
 *     than Claude (item.started / item.updated / item.completed / turn.*),
 *     so `defaultQuery()` includes a small adapter that translates Codex
 *     events into the Claude-shaped frames the rest of the dispatcher
 *     consumes — keeps the wake / coalesce / budget / catch-up logic
 *     completely host-agnostic.
 *
 *   - Concurrency is capped via a small semaphore (default 10). Beyond
 *     that, wakes queue. This is a hard floor on Anthropic-side cost:
 *     50 simultaneous wakes = 50 simultaneous Claude calls, which the
 *     user is unlikely to want by default.
 *
 *   - Task events get an explicit "claim + submit_result" instruction
 *     in the wake prompt so the call_agent long-poll on the master API
 *     resolves cleanly. Mail events just say "you've got new mail" and
 *     trust the persona to do the right thing (read / reply / archive).

 *
 *   1. **Reply loops.** Agent A replies-all → agents B/C/D wake → one
 *      of them replies-all → A wakes again on its own thread → ad
 *      infinitum. Without a brake this burns tokens forever.
 *
 *   2. **Storms.** 10 agents CC'd on the same thread = every reply
 *      wakes 9 workers. Most "stay silent" but each still costs one
 *      Claude turn. We let this work naturally up to a point, but
 *      cap the absolute number per (agent, thread).
 *
 *   3. **Stuck agents.** One agent keeps replying without progress.
 *      Per-(agent, thread) cap catches this even if the persona-level
 *      "stay silent unless it's your turn" rule fails.
 *
 * # Design
 *
 * One entry per (account.id, threadId) tuple. Each entry tracks how
 * many times we've spawned a worker for that combination, plus the
 * timestamp of the first wake in the current window. When the count
 * hits `maxWakesPerThread`, further wakes for that pair are dropped
 * with a log line — until the window expires and the entry resets.
 *
 * The window is wall-clock-relative (not sliding) which is the cheap-
 * and-good-enough trade-off: a thread that maxes out at minute 0 of a
 * 24h window stays muted for the full 24h. That's the right behaviour
 * — if a thread is generating runaway wakes, we WANT it muted for a
 * long time, not for the agent to be re-wakeable as soon as its 24h
 * window slides past oldest entry.
 *
 * The store is bounded by periodic GC (every wake we sweep entries
 * older than the window). Set growth is therefore proportional to
 * unique active threads in the window, not total history.

    ``,
    `2. **If this is a reply (Subject starts with "Re:" or an In-Reply-To header is present), load the rest of the thread.**`,
    `   Use search_emails({ subject: "<core subject without Re:>", _account: "${agent.name}" })`,
    `   to surface earlier messages in the thread, then read_email each prior UID.`,
    `   You MUST read the full thread before deciding what to do.`,
    ``,

    `   (from: ${agent.email}). If you have already contributed your work`,
    `   to this thread, **do NOT redo it on a new wake**. Redelivering`,

    `   <name>@localhost. They will each be woken on every reply-all the same way you were.`,
    ``,
    `5. **Decide: is it MY turn?** Yes if any of:`,
    `     - The latest message addresses you by name ("Vesper, please …", "@${agent.name} …").`,
    `     - The previous-stage handoff is to your role (e.g. designer → developer, and you are the developer).`,
    `     - You were directly asked a question and nobody has answered yet.`,
    `   No if:`,
    `     - The current ask is targeted at a teammate (their turn, not yours).`,
    `     - **A teammate replied within the last 60 seconds.** They are likely`,

    `   WebSearch, NotebookEdit, etc. If the task is "implement X", write the file`,

    `   Sign with your name. Be substantive but concise.`,
    ``,
    `   ## Reply addressing — CRITICAL for wake control`,
    `   reply_email({ replyAll: true }) automatically builds the right shape:`,
    `   the ORIGINAL SENDER ends up on To (so they wake by default),`,
    `   every other participant ends up on Cc (so they see it without`,
    `   waking). DO NOT pass a hand-rolled comma-separated address list`,
    `   via send_email — that puts every recipient on To and re-wakes`,
    `   the whole thread, defeating the wake gating. Trust replyAll.`,
    ``,
    `   If you want to wake someone OTHER than the original sender`,
    `   (e.g. you are handing off to a different next actor), name them`,
    `   explicitly in the reply body ("Orion — over to you, please…")`,
    `   AND pass \`wake: ["orion"]\` so the dispatcher gives them a`,
    `   Claude turn instead. Example:`,

    `                   wake: ["orion"], _account: "${agent.name}" })`,
    `   If nobody specific is next (the work is complete and you're just`,
    `   signing off), pass \`wake: []\` to deliver silently — every`,
    `   participant still sees the reply, no Claude turn is spawned.`,
    ``,
    `7. **If you need additional help from a teammate not yet on the thread,**`,
    `   include them by CC'ing in your reply-all — DO NOT spin up a separate`,
    `   call_agent / message_agent side-channel. The thread is the workspace;`,
    `   everyone stays in context.`,
    ``,
    `8. **If it's NOT your turn,** mark the message read with mark_read and return.`,

    `## How threads end`,

    `message with one of these markers in the subject: \`[FINAL]\`, \`[DONE]\`,`,

    `further replies to that thread. If you are sending a wrap-up yourself`,

 *   { type: 'result',    result: <final text>, usage: { input_tokens, output_tokens, ... } }
 *
 * Codex emits a different shape — `ThreadEvent` from `@openai/codex-sdk`:
 *
 *   { type: 'thread.started', thread_id }
 *   { type: 'turn.started' }
 *   { type: 'item.started' | 'item.updated' | 'item.completed', item: ThreadItem }
 *   { type: 'turn.completed', usage: Usage }
 *   { type: 'turn.failed', error }
 *   { type: 'error', message }
 *
 * `ThreadItem` is one of: agent_message, reasoning, command_execution,
 * file_change, mcp_tool_call, web_search, todo_list, error.
 *
 * The adapter below translates Codex events into Claude-shaped frames so
 * the dispatcher's spawnWorker / runWorker / observer pipeline stays
 * untouched. The translation table:
 *
 *   agent_message (completed)     → { assistant: [{ text }] }
 *   mcp_tool_call  (started)      → { assistant: [{ tool_use: mcp__<server>__<tool>, input }] }
 *   mcp_tool_call  (completed/err)→ { user:      [{ tool_result: <content> }] }
 *   command_execution             → { assistant: [{ tool_use: Bash, input: {command} }] }
 *                                 + { user:      [{ tool_result: <aggregated_output> }] }
 *   file_change                   → { assistant: [{ tool_use: Edit, input: {changes} }] }
 *   web_search                    → { assistant: [{ tool_use: WebSearch, input: {query} }] }
 *   reasoning                     → dropped (internal; Claude doesn't surface these either)
 *   todo_list                     → dropped (no Claude equivalent)
 *   turn.completed                → { result: <final_message_text>, usage: <mapped> }
 *
 * The `read_email` UID dedup logic added in 0.9.5 still works: it greps
 * `tool_use` breadcrumbs for `read_email\b[^}]*"uid":<n>`, and the mapped
 * tool_use name `mcp__agenticmail__read_email` matches on the `read_email`
 * substring with the unchanged `input.uid` arg.
