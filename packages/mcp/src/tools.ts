 * env block in its host's config. The value is used by:
 *
 *   1. `create_account` — to auto-stamp `metadata.host` on every new agent
 *      so dispatchers and installers can route correctly.
 *   2. `list_agents` / `check_activity` / `inbox_digest` — to scope the
 *      response to the calling host's own teammates. Without this filter,
 *      a Codex session calling `check_activity` sees Claude-owned workers
 *      (and vice versa), which is confusing UX and a (mild) information
 *      leak across host boundaries.
 *
