/**
 * Categorisation of the MCP tool surface into "sets", used by the
 * `request_tools` meta-tool.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * Loading all 62 tool schemas into a Claude Code subagent's context costs
 * ~10K tokens per spawn — most of it never used. To stay cheap, subagents
 * are launched with a small curated whitelist (the ESSENTIAL set below)
 * plus a `request_tools` meta-tool. When they need something outside the
 * curated set, they call `request_tools` to discover what exists, then
 * `invoke` to call it by name.
 *
 * This mirrors the enterprise tool-resolver's three-tier lazy-loading
 * design (see /enterprise/src/agent-tools/tool-resolver.ts), adapted for
 * the constraint that Claude Code's subagent tool list is fixed at spawn
 * time — so instead of dynamically extending the tool list, we let the
 * agent dispatch through a single generic `invoke` tool.
 *
 * # Editing the catalogue
 *
 * Adding a new tool to AgenticMail: drop it into the right set below
 * (and if no set fits, create one — keep them small and topical).
 *
 * Adding a new SET: keep `SET_DESCRIPTIONS` aligned with `TOOL_SETS`.
 * The order in SET_DESCRIPTIONS is the order shown to the agent by
 * request_tools, so put the most-commonly-needed sets first.
 *
 * Anything in NO set still works via `invoke` — `request_tools` will
 * surface it under an `"_uncategorised"` heading. That's a soft signal
 * to come back here and categorise it properly, but won't break.
