This file follows the [agents.md](https://agents.md) convention.

---

## 1. If the user asks you to install AgenticMail

**Pick one of these two paths. Don't ask the user which — pick A.**

```bash
# Option A (recommended): one-line curl installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agenticmail/agenticmail/main/install.sh | bash

# Option B: manual two-command install (use if curl-bash is blocked)
npm install -g @agenticmail/cli@latest
agenticmail bootstrap
```

Both paths do the same thing. The curl installer just adds a Node 22+
preflight check and prints platform-specific upgrade instructions if
Node is missing or too old. Pass `--dry-run` to the curl version
(`curl -fsSL … | bash -s -- --dry-run`) if the user wants to see what
it will do without executing.

`bootstrap` is a non-interactive pipeline
that:

1. Auto-installs Colima + Docker via `brew` (macOS) or `apt` (Linux)
   if they're missing. **No Docker Desktop, no GUI gates.**
2. Generates a master key and master config under `~/.agenticmail/`.
3. Starts the Stalwart mail server in a Colima/Docker container.
4. Registers a launchd / systemd unit so the API auto-starts on boot.
5. Provisions a default agent.
6. Waits for `GET http://127.0.0.1:3829/api/agenticmail/health` to
   return 200 (port read from config, never hardcoded).
7. Wires the Claude Code integration (`agenticmail claudecode`) —
   harmless no-op if Claude Code isn't installed.

External email relay (Gmail / custom domain) and SMS are deliberately
SKIPPED — those need user-owned credentials nobody else has. The
default install gives a fully working **local-only** AgenticMail
where agents email each other at `*@localhost`. The user can add
external mail any time later with `agenticmail setup` (interactive).

**Prereqs you can rely on being present** on a typical dev machine:
- Node.js 22+ (we use `node:sqlite`; no native compilation)
- `brew` (macOS) or `apt` / `yum` (Linux)

**Prereqs the user must install themselves** if missing:
- Node.js 22+ — if `node -v` shows `<22`, tell the user to install
  Node 22 (`brew install node@22` or `nvm install 22 && nvm use 22`).
  Do NOT try to run bootstrap on Node 20 — `@agenticmail/core@0.7.x`
  uses the built-in `node:sqlite` module which requires Node 22.

After `bootstrap` finishes, tell the user to **restart Claude Code**
(or whichever MCP-aware client they use) so the new MCP server entry
in `~/.claude.json` takes effect.

---

## 2. If the user asks you to use AgenticMail for multi-agent coordination

**This is the single most-misused thing in this codebase.** Read carefully.
The pattern below is provider-agnostic — it applies whether your host is
Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Grok, Aider, or any other MCP client.

AgenticMail agents are **persistent identities with their own inboxes,
API keys, personas, and audit trails**. They coordinate the way humans
do: in **shared email threads**, with everyone CC'd, taking turns
implicitly from context.

### Preferred pattern — single thread, CC everyone

This is how a human boss coordinates a small team and it is the right
primitive for AgenticMail too:

```
1. list_agents()                            // discover, or...
2. create_account({ name: "Vesper", role: "creative-director" })
   create_account({ name: "Orion",  role: "developer" })

3. send_email({
     to:   "vesper@localhost",                          // primary owner of step 1
     cc:   "orion@localhost, claudecode@localhost",     // teammates + yourself
     subject: "Build a small terminal game",
     text: [
       "Team —",
       "",
       "Vesper, please design a minimal terminal game (under ~80 LOC).",
       "Reply-all with the design doc when ready.",
       "",
       "Orion, once Vesper signs off, implement it and reply-all with the code.",
       "",
       "I (the host) will watch the thread and step in if needed.",
     ].join("\n"),
   })

4. list_inbox / read_email on your bridge inbox to watch progress.
   Step in by reply-all'ing into the same thread whenever needed.
```

What happens under the hood:
- The mail server pushes an SSE wake-up to **every local recipient**
  the moment the email lands.
- Each agent wakes, reads the **full thread**, sees who else is CC'd,
  and decides if it's their turn. Vesper goes first because she was
  named first in the body. Orion stays silent until Vesper hands off.
  You (the host) see every reply in your bridge inbox.
- Thread continues until someone says "done" or no agent has anything
  to add. No RPC, no scheduler, no out-of-band protocol.

### When to use `call_agent` instead

Only when you need **one structured answer from one agent**, inline in
your current host turn. Examples: "what's the current count of unread
mail in Fola's inbox?", "produce a JSON list of contacts tagged
'investor'". For anything multi-step or multi-agent, prefer the thread.

### Wrong way (do not do this — regardless of host)

```
✗ create_account({ name: "Vesper" })
✗ <host>.spawn_sub_agent({ prompt: "You are Vesper the designer..." })
✗ send_email({ from: bridge, to: "orion@localhost",
               text: "<the brief your native sub-agent wrote>" })
```

That spawns a generic sub-agent under YOUR identity (no Vesper persona,
no Vesper mailbox, no audit trail) and then forges mail "from" Vesper.
The AgenticMail agent named "Vesper" never actually thought anything —
you just used her name as a label on a manually-shuttled message.

Equally wrong: serialising the work yourself with sequential
`call_agent` calls ("get Vesper's design, then call Orion with it").
That works but is fragile and slow. The thread pattern lets the
agents drive their own handoffs.

### Why this matters

- Every agent has **full context every time they wake** — they read
  the whole thread, not just the latest message.
- Turn-taking is implicit; no scheduler, no RPC ceremony.
- The thread is **searchable history**. The host sees everything.
- Bringing in another teammate later is just adding them to CC.
- Per-agent signatures, outbound guard, persona consistency, and
  audit trail all stay intact — everything you lose by roleplaying.

### TL;DR rule

> If the human says "have agents A and B coordinate", reach for
> `send_email` with everyone on CC. Let them take turns in the thread.
> Use `call_agent` only for one-shot RPC. Never reach for your host's
> native sub-agent tool with a roleplay prompt.

## 3. If the user asks you to set up the Claude Code integration

If AgenticMail is already installed (`agenticmail --version` works,
`curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3829/api/agenticmail/health` returns 200):

```bash
agenticmail claudecode
```

One command. It:
- Provisions a dedicated `claudecode` bridge agent inside AgenticMail
  (idempotent — reuses if already present)
- Writes an MCP server entry to `~/.claude.json`
- Generates one Claude Code subagent file per AgenticMail agent under
  `~/.claude/agents/agenticmail-<name>.md`
- Starts the dispatcher daemon under PM2 (PM2 must be installed;
  `npm install -g pm2` if missing)

Then tell the user to restart Claude Code.

To check current status: `agenticmail claudecode --status`.
To remove: `agenticmail claudecode --remove`.

---

## 4. If the user asks "what is AgenticMail" / "what does it do"

It's a self-hosted email + SMS platform for AI agents. Each agent
gets a real email address, an inbox, and an API key. Agents email
each other for coordination (real RFC-822 mail through a local
Stalwart server), and optionally email the public internet through
a Gmail relay or a custom domain.

The Claude Code integration (`@agenticmail/claudecode`, new in 0.7/0.8)
makes every AgenticMail agent callable as a native Claude Code subagent
via `Agent { subagent_type: "agenticmail-<name>" }`, AND auto-wakes
agents when mail arrives in their inbox (workers run inside the
user's existing Claude Code OAuth — no separate Anthropic key needed).

---

## 5. If the user asks you to verify it's working

```bash
agenticmail status                   # service health
agenticmail claudecode --status      # integration health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3829/api/agenticmail/health   # raw API health
```

Inside a fresh Claude Code session after restart:

```
Agent { subagent_type: "agenticmail-secretary", prompt: "what's your name and email?" }
```

The subagent should respond as the bridge agent ("secretary" by
default — or whatever default agent the bootstrap created).

---

## 6. If the user wants to see what their agents have been doing

Point them at the interactive shell:

```bash
agenticmail shell
```

That's the right surface for **human, visual** oversight. From the shell
the user can list every agent, read any inbox, send and reply on their
behalf, inspect pending outbound mail (the outbound-guard approval
queue), watch the dispatcher event feed live, prune stale agents, and
run any of the 44+ shell commands.

When to point the user here vs. doing it yourself via MCP:

| User said… | Right answer |
|---|---|
| "show me what my agents have been doing" | `agenticmail shell` |
| "let me see Fola's inbox" | `agenticmail shell` (or run it for them via Bash) |
| "check on the team" | `agenticmail shell` |
| "audit the last hour" | `agenticmail shell` |
| "have Fola reply to my last email from accounting" | MCP — do it via `mcp__agenticmail__call_agent` or `Agent { subagent_type: "agenticmail-fola" }` |
| "coordinate Vesper and Orion on this build" | MCP — `send_email` with both on CC, then `wait_for_email` |

Rule of thumb: **shell for visual monitoring by a human, MCP for
programmatic work driven by you.**

---

## 7. If something goes wrong

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `agenticmail: command not found` after install | npm global bin not in `$PATH` | `echo $PATH \| grep $(npm bin -g)` — if missing, `export PATH="$(npm bin -g):$PATH"` |
| `npm install` fails on `node-gyp` / `better-sqlite3` | User is on `@agenticmail/cli@<0.8` (older release that still used `better-sqlite3`) | `npm install -g @agenticmail/cli@latest` — 0.7.x core uses `node:sqlite`, no native build |
| `Cannot find package 'sqlite'` at runtime | Node < 22 | Install Node 22+ (`brew install node@22`) |
| Stalwart container won't start | Colima not running | `colima start` then re-run `agenticmail bootstrap` |
| Bootstrap times out at Phase 3 | API server isn't coming up — usually means Stalwart's first-run init is slow | `tail -f ~/.agenticmail/logs/server.log` for the real error |
| Port `3829` already in use | Something else bound it | Edit `~/.agenticmail/config.json` to set `api.port` to a free port, then `agenticmail start` |

---

## 8. Repository layout (for agents modifying the code)

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `packages/core/` | `@agenticmail/core` — DB layer, account/mail/gateway managers, spam filter, search index. Uses `node:sqlite` (Node 22+). |
| `packages/api/` | `@agenticmail/api` — Express REST API. Mounts integration routes when `@agenticmail/claudecode` is installed. |
| `packages/mcp/` | `@agenticmail/mcp` — MCP server (62 tools + `request_tools`/`invoke` meta-tools + `_account` per-call identity). |
| `packages/claudecode/` | `@agenticmail/claudecode` — Claude Code integration. Dispatcher daemon, persona engine, HTTP install endpoint, subagent .md generator. |
| `packages/openclaw/` | `@agenticmail/openclaw` — OpenClaw runtime integration. Older code path, still pinned to `@agenticmail/core@^0.5`. |
| `agenticmail/` | `@agenticmail/cli` — the user-facing `agenticmail` binary. Imports from `@agenticmail/api`, exposes `setup`, `bootstrap`, `start`, `claudecode`, `openclaw`, etc. |

## 9. Build / test / lint commands

```bash
npm install                                  # install all workspace deps
npm run build                                # build every workspace
npm run test                                 # run every workspace's tests
npm run build --workspace=@agenticmail/core  # build one package
npx vitest run -w packages/claudecode        # run one package's tests
```

Test counts as of `0.8.2`:
- `@agenticmail/core`: 339 specs
- `@agenticmail/claudecode`: 75 specs
- `@agenticmail/mcp`: 8 specs (catalogue audit)

## 10. Conventions to follow when contributing

- **ES modules everywhere.** No CommonJS.
- **Type imports** use `import { type X } from '...'` not `import type X from ...`.
- **Database access** goes through `Database` exported from
  `@agenticmail/core` (which is `node:sqlite`'s `DatabaseSync`). Do not
  add a `better-sqlite3` dependency back.
- **Default API port is `3829`.** If you need to hardcode a port
  somewhere, read it from `~/.agenticmail/config.json`'s `api.port`
  instead.
- **Engines `>=22` for all packages that depend on `@agenticmail/core`**
  (because of `node:sqlite`). Openclaw stays on `>=20` because it
  still depends on `@agenticmail/core@^0.5`.
- **Releases follow the `@agenticmail/cli` version**. Tag is `v<cli-version>`
  on GitHub. Commit message: `Release X.Y.Z: <short description>`.
- **CHANGELOG.md** at repo root uses Keep-a-Changelog format with
  `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed` sections. Update it on
  every release.

## 11. What NOT to do

- **Don't `npm install` random packages** to "fix" something. Most
  things are already wired correctly; if you can't find what you need,
  read the existing code first.
- **Don't add `better-sqlite3` back as a dependency.** The `node:sqlite`
  migration was deliberate and is documented in `CHANGELOG.md@0.8.2`.
- **Don't change the default port** without updating every README and
  the bootstrap pipeline.
- **Don't commit `package-lock.json` without regenerating it** —
  workspace version bumps require `npm install --package-lock-only`
  before commit, or CI will fail with `EUSAGE`.
- **Don't skip the CHANGELOG entry** when shipping a release.
