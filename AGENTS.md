# AGENTS.md — instructions for AI agents working with AgenticMail

This file follows the [agents.md](https://agents.md) convention.

---

## 1. If the user asks you to install AgenticMail

**Pick one of these two paths. Don't ask the user which — pick A.**

```bash
# Option A (recommended): one-line curl installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agenticmail/agenticmail/main/install.sh | bash

# Option B: manual two-command install (use if curl-bash is blocked)
npm install -g @agenticmail/cli@latest
agenticmail bootstrap
```

Both paths do the same thing. The curl installer just adds a Node 22+
preflight check and prints platform-specific upgrade instructions if
Node is missing or too old. Pass `--dry-run` to the curl version
(`curl -fsSL … | bash -s -- --dry-run`) if the user wants to see what
it will do without executing.

`bootstrap` is a non-interactive pipeline
that:

1. Auto-installs Colima + Docker via `brew` (macOS) or `apt` (Linux)
   if they're missing. **No Docker Desktop, no GUI gates.**
2. Generates a master key and master config under `~/.agenticmail/`.
3. Starts the Stalwart mail server in a Colima/Docker container.
4. Registers a launchd / systemd unit so the API auto-starts on boot.
5. Provisions a default agent.
6. Waits for `GET http://127.0.0.1:3829/api/agenticmail/health` to
   return 200 (port read from config, never hardcoded).
7. Wires the Claude Code integration (`agenticmail claudecode`) and
   the OpenAI Codex CLI integration (`agenticmail codex`) — both are
   harmless no-ops if their host CLI isn't installed.

External email relay (Gmail / custom domain) and SMS are deliberately
SKIPPED — those need user-owned credentials nobody else has. The
default install gives a fully working **local-only** AgenticMail
where agents email each other at `*@localhost`. The user can add
external mail any time later with `agenticmail setup` (interactive).

**Prereqs you can rely on being present** on a typical dev machine:
- Node.js 22+ (we use `node:sqlite`; no native compilation)
- `brew` (macOS) or `apt` / `yum` (Linux)

**Prereqs the user must install themselves** if missing:
- Node.js 22+ — if `node -v` shows `<22`, tell the user to install
  Node 22 (`brew install node@22` or `nvm install 22 && nvm use 22`).
  Do NOT try to run bootstrap on Node 20 — `@agenticmail/core@0.7.x`
  uses the built-in `node:sqlite` module which requires Node 22.

After `bootstrap` finishes, tell the user to **restart their host CLI**
(Claude Code, Codex, or whichever MCP-aware client they use) so the
new MCP server entry takes effect. The MCP block lands in
`~/.claude.json` for Claude Code and `~/.codex/config.toml` for Codex.

### IMMEDIATELY after bootstrap — ASK the user about the optional channels

The bootstrap intentionally skips everything that needs user-owned
credentials. Most users want at least one of these wired up, and they
won't know to ask. **Don't end the install conversation without
walking through this checklist** — phrase it as one question per
channel so the user can opt in or out individually.

**Step 0 — Anthropic token (do this FIRST, before any of the others).**
Without it, the Telegram bridge and the Claude Code dispatcher have
no auth and silently fail. Most operators don't realize this is a
separate step. Run:

```bash
agenticmail setup-anthropic
```

This wraps `claude setup-token` (browser OAuth), live-validates the
token, and writes it to `~/.agenticmail/anthropic-token` (0600). If
the operator already has an API key they can skip the browser flow
with `agenticmail setup-anthropic --api-key sk-ant-api03-...`. See
the `setup-anthropic` section below for the full runbook and the
failure-classification table.

Then ask about the channels:

> "Bootstrap is done. Before I close out, want me to wire up any of
> these now? (Yes / no for each — I'll skip the ones you say no to.)
>
> 1. **External email** — agents become reachable on the real internet
>    (e.g. `yourname+secretary@gmail.com`). Needs a Gmail app password
>    or Outlook app password. You'll paste it into the terminal, not
>    here.
>
> 2. **Phone calls (Twilio or 46elks)** — agents can place real
>    outbound phone calls. Needs the carrier's Account SID + Auth
>    Token, plus a number from that carrier. I'll open a free
>    Cloudflare quick-tunnel so the webhooks reach your machine —
>    no domain or static IP needed.
>
> 3. **Telegram bot** — DM your agent from your phone, agent replies
>    in the same chat with full memory + tools. Needs a bot token
>    from @BotFather (free, 30 seconds)."

For each YES the user gives, run the matching non-interactive
subcommand. **Have the user export the secret as an env var before
running** — never accept secrets in chat (same rule as the email
password, same rationale: shell history + LLM context window
hygiene). Example flow if the user says yes to Twilio:

> "OK, Twilio. Open your Twilio console → Account → API keys & tokens,
> copy the Account SID and the primary Auth Token, then in your
> terminal:
>
> ```bash
> export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID='ACxxxx...'
> export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN='your-auth-token'
> export AGENTICMAIL_PHONE_NUMBER='+15555550100'  # your Twilio number
> agenticmail setup-phone --provider twilio
> ```
>
> Tell me when it succeeds. I won't see the token."

Same pattern for the other two channels — env-piped secrets, you
run the subcommand for them or have them run it themselves:

```bash
# Email — see "Setting up the email relay" section below
agenticmail setup-email

# Phone calls (Twilio — auto-opens a quick-tunnel if no AGENTICMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=… TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=… AGENTICMAIL_PHONE_NUMBER=… \
  agenticmail setup-phone --provider twilio

# Phone calls (46elks alternative)
ELKS_USERNAME=… ELKS_PASSWORD=… AGENTICMAIL_PHONE_NUMBER=… \
  agenticmail setup-phone --provider 46elks

# Telegram bot
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=… TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=… \
  agenticmail setup-telegram
```

The user can always re-run any of these later. Skipping during
install is fine — but don't skip the *question*.

### Setting up the email relay — NEVER ask for the password in chat

The bridge-escalation email path (next section) needs a working outbound relay so the API can deliver mail to the operator's personal mailbox. If `setup_operator_email` is set but the relay isn't, escalation emails fail silently (logged server-side, but no delivery).

**Critical rule:** the email account password (app password for Gmail / Outlook, mailbox password for custom domains) is a credential. If the operator pastes it into your chat, it ends up in the LLM's context window, training data risks, and conversation history. **Don't ask for it. Don't accept it if offered.**

Instead, tell the operator to run this command in their own terminal:

```bash
agenticmail setup-email
```

The command:

- Prompts for their email address (visible — that's fine, not secret)
- Auto-detects the provider from the domain (Gmail, Outlook / Microsoft 365, or custom). For unknown domains it asks whether the mailbox lives on Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, or a custom SMTP server (and only in the custom case asks for SMTP/IMAP hosts).
- Prompts for the **password** via hidden stdin (raw-mode `*`-masked, never leaves the process)
- Calls `POST /api/agenticmail/gateway/relay`, which verifies SMTP + IMAP auth before persisting
- Prints success / failure

You just wait. When the operator says "done", proceed to `setup_operator_email`. If they hit an error you can help diagnose from the spinner output they paste back — but you should never see the literal password.

If the operator is already at the keyboard and you want to give them the exact line to run, this is the right script:

> "Run `agenticmail setup-email` in your terminal. It'll ask for your email address and a password — for Gmail use an app password (generate one at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords — needs 2FA on your Google account); for Outlook use an app password from your Microsoft account security settings. The password input is hidden — I won't see it. Tell me when it's done."

> **`setup-relay` vs `setup-email`** — `setup-email` (added in 0.9.38) is the recommended short path: two questions, auto-detected provider, supports Gmail + Outlook + custom. `setup-relay` is the older full-interactive flow with explicit provider menus, agent-naming, and retry loops. Both write the same relay config; pick whichever fits.

### What the operator needs to KNOW before `setup-email` — surface this proactively

The moment `agenticmail setup-email` succeeds, the operator's sub-agents become reachable from the public internet via plus-addressing. Most operators don't realize this. **Tell them before they run the command** so they can opt in deliberately:

> "Heads up — once we connect this, anyone on the internet who knows the address can email `<your-relay>+<agentname>@gmail.com` and that sub-agent will wake up and process it. The plus-suffix is publicly guessable (`+secretary`, `+kepler`, etc.) so don't treat it as a secret. If that's not what you want yet, we can skip this step and your agents will just keep talking to each other locally over `*@localhost`. Otherwise I'll continue and warn you about spam wake-budgets afterward."

What's actually happening under the hood (for your own model — paraphrase, don't paste):

- Every sub-agent gets a publicly addressable inbox the moment setup-email finishes.
- External mail wakes the dispatcher identically to internal `@localhost` mail — source doesn't matter; an SSE new-mail event is an SSE new-mail event.
- The host bridges (`<relay>+claudecode@gmail.com` and `<relay>+codex@gmail.com`) take a different path — they route to `handleBridgeMail` which does headless session resume via the SDK, falling through to bridge-escalation email if resume fails.
- Spam to any sub-agent wakes Claude / Codex turns. The `wake-budget` guard in `dispatcher.handleEvent` is the throttle; relay-level spam filtering is the cleaner long-term answer.

If the operator says yes anyway (most do), continue with `setup-email`. If they say no, skip it — `*@localhost` coordination still works fully without a relay.

### `setup-anthropic` — connect the Anthropic auth token (do this FIRST)

The Telegram bridge and the Claude Code dispatcher both call `claude -p` under the hood, and `claude -p` needs an Anthropic auth token to do anything. Without it, the bridge silently fails (Telegram messages get an "auth-failed" reply; email mentions trigger no agent turn at all). **Walk the operator through this before phone / telegram setup** — it's the single most common reason a brand-new install looks like it "isn't doing anything".

Two paths, pick the one that matches the operator's account type:

**Path A — Claude Code subscription (most common, free for Pro/Team users):**

```bash
agenticmail setup-anthropic
```

This wraps `claude setup-token` — opens a browser, the operator logs into `console.anthropic.com`, copies the long-lived OAuth token (`sk-ant-oat01-...`) it prints, pastes it back into the hidden prompt. We then live-validate it against `api.anthropic.com` (one `claude-haiku-4-5` call with `max_tokens: 1` — effectively free) before writing to `~/.agenticmail/anthropic-token` (0600). If validation fails the wizard explains *why* in plain English: `auth-failed` → token's revoked; `subscription-disabled` → org has Claude Code access turned off (point them at Path B); `rate-limited` → wait a minute; `network` → use `--skip-validate`.

Prereq: `claude` must be on PATH. If it isn't, the wizard prints `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` and exits cleanly.

**Path B — direct API key (pay-per-token, works for any account):**

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-api03-...' agenticmail setup-anthropic
# or:
agenticmail setup-anthropic --api-key sk-ant-api03-...
```

Same live-validation, same destination file. Use this when the operator's org has disabled Claude Code subscription access (you'll see "🚫 subscription-disabled" in Telegram replies otherwise).

**Why this matters operationally:**

- The Telegram bridge reads `~/.agenticmail/anthropic-token` at every spawn — so refreshing the token via `agenticmail setup-anthropic` takes effect on the *next* inbound message, no restart needed.
- The dispatcher reads the same file at boot and sets `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` before the SDK loads. Restart the dispatcher (`pm2 restart agenticmail-claudecode-dispatcher` or `agenticmail stop && agenticmail start`) after `setup-anthropic` to pick up the new token.
- The dispatcher uses OAuth-bearer auth (with the `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` header) on `/v1/messages` — this bypasses subscription-routed paths, so OAuth tokens keep working on `/v1/messages` even when subscription endpoints are disabled.

**When things go wrong at runtime (telegram chat):**

The bridge classifies `claude -p` stderr into actionable categories and forwards a friendly message to the operator's Telegram chat instead of a raw stack trace:

| Category | Telegram message starts with |
| --- | --- |
| `rate-limited` | ⏳ |
| `quota-exceeded` | 💳 |
| `subscription-disabled` | 🚫 (suggests `--api-key` flow) |
| `auth-failed` | 🔒 (suggests `agenticmail setup-anthropic`) |
| `overloaded` | 🛠️ |

If the operator says "the bot just told me it hit a quota / rate limit / auth error", that's where it came from — the bridge isn't broken, it just hit the source.

### `setup-voice` — pick a voice runtime (OpenAI / Grok / future)

The realtime voice bridge that drives live phone calls supports multiple backends through a drop-in plugin directory at `packages/core/src/phone/voice-providers/`. Currently registered: **OpenAI Realtime** (`gpt-realtime`, the default) and **xAI Grok Voice Agent** (`grok-voice-latest`). Both speak the same OpenAI-Realtime WebSocket protocol so the bridge code is provider-agnostic.

One unified command for any provider:

```bash
# OpenAI (default — keeps existing installs working)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... agenticmail setup-voice --provider openai

# Grok — also set it as the install-wide default
XAI_API_KEY=xai-... agenticmail setup-voice --provider grok --default
```

Without `--key` and without the env var, the command opens a hidden-input prompt. Without `--provider` and at a TTY, it shows a picker.

**Per-call override:** even if the install-wide default is `openai`, an individual call can pin Grok by setting `policy.voiceRuntime = "grok"` on the `call_phone` MCP tool. Useful for A/B'ing voices, cost-tuning, or routing certain customer-types to a specific runtime.

**Where keys land:** `~/.agenticmail/config.json` under `voiceProviderKeys.<id>` (encrypted-at-rest via the master key on the runtime side). OpenAI keeps its legacy `openaiApiKey` field for backcompat. Existing installs upgrade transparently.

**Adding a new backend** (Anthropic realtime, Cartesia, ElevenLabs ConvAI, ...): drop a file into `packages/core/src/phone/voice-providers/<id>.ts` exporting a `registerVoiceProvider({...})` call, add one import line to the barrel index, rebuild. No other file in the codebase needs to change — the realtime bridge looks providers up by id through the registry.

**Picking the voice character.** Each provider declares its catalogue (`voices: ['ara', 'eve', 'leo']` for Grok; `voices: ['alloy', ..., 'cedar', ..., 'marin', ...]` for OpenAI). `setup-voice` shows a picker after the key step. Operator can also pin a voice per-agent with `agenticmail persona --voice <name> --agent <agent>` — the choice lives in the persona file's YAML frontmatter (`voice: cedar` / `voiceRuntime: openai`) and the bridge reads it on every call. Per-call overrides ride on `mission.policy.voice` / `policy.voiceRuntime` / `policy.voiceModel` — useful for A/B'ing voices or routing different customer-types to different runtimes. Resolution order: **mission policy > agent persona > install default > provider default.**

### `setup-phone` — Twilio / 46elks outbound voice (optional)

If the operator wants the agent to place phone calls, run this — same shape as `setup-email`, with secrets piped via env vars instead of typed on the command line:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID='<sid>' \
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN='<token>' \
AGENTICMAIL_PHONE_NUMBER='<your Twilio number in E.164, e.g. +15555550100>' \
  agenticmail setup-phone --provider twilio
```

For 46elks: `--provider 46elks` with `ELKS_USERNAME` + `ELKS_PASSWORD` instead of the Twilio pair.

**No public HTTPS URL needed.** Twilio/46elks webhook back into the local machine, but `setup-phone` automatically opens a free Cloudflare quick-tunnel (`*.trycloudflare.com`, no Cloudflare account required) and uses that as the webhook target. The tunnel persists across runs at `~/.agenticmail/tunnel.json`. If the operator has their own domain (e.g. `agenticmail setup` in domain mode) they can pass `AGENTICMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL=https://their-domain/` and skip the quick-tunnel.

**The credentials never reach the LLM.** Tell the operator to source them from env vars or a vault — same rule as the email password. The auth token is stored encrypted at rest under the master key.

### `setup-telegram` — Telegram bot bridge (optional)

If the operator wants to DM their agent from their phone:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN='<token from @BotFather>' \
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID='<numeric chat id of the allowed sender>' \
  agenticmail setup-telegram
```

The chat id is the operator's own Telegram numeric id — restricts who can DM the bot. Find it by DMing the new bot once then visiting `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`.

What this does:
1. Registers the channel against the API (POST `/telegram/setup`)
2. Writes three files at `~/.agenticmail/telegram/` — `telegram-token`, `telegram-allowed-ids`, `agent-key` (all `0600`)
3. Next `agenticmail start` auto-spawns the standalone Telegram bridge service alongside the API

The bridge spawns `claude -p` per inbound DM with `@agenticmail/mcp` registered as an MCP server, so the bot has the **same toolset and same memory** as the dispatcher's email-driven workers: it can place phone calls, send emails, look things up, all from inside a Telegram thread.

### Right after install — ASK THE USER for their notification email

This is the SECOND thing to do after `bootstrap` finishes, before dispatcher tuning. When a sub-agent mails the host bridge (`wake: ["codex"]` / `wake: ["claudecode"]`) and the dispatcher CAN'T resume your CLI session (you closed the window, session token expired, etc.), it forwards a digest to a configured operator email so you get a phone push. Without this set, escalations are silent unless you're actively watching the web UI.

Ask:

> "When a sub-agent needs your attention and you're not at the keyboard, where should we email you? (typically your personal Gmail — it gets phone push notifications by default)"

Then call the MCP tool with their answer:

```
mcp__agenticmail__setup_operator_email({ email: "their-address@example.com" })
```

To check / change later:

```
mcp__agenticmail__setup_operator_email({ email: "new-address@example.com" })
mcp__agenticmail__setup_operator_email({ email: "" })  // clear, no email forward
```

The address is stored at `~/.agenticmail/operator-prefs.json`. Master-key scoped — never per-agent.

### Right after install — ASK THE USER about dispatcher tuning

The dispatcher ships with conservative defaults so a fresh install
can't accidentally rack up cost. Power users coordinating active
multi-agent threads hit the defaults quickly. **As the installing
agent, you must ask the user this question right after `bootstrap`
finishes:**

> "How many times do you want each agent to wake on the same email
> thread within a 24-hour window?
>
> - **10** (default) — safe; good for casual use
> - **50** — typical for active multi-agent coordination
> - **100+** — power users running long-running design ↔ build ↔ review threads
> - **0** to disable the limit entirely (not recommended)
>
> You can change this any time later by running:
>     agenticmail-claudecode tune --max-wakes-per-thread N
> Or by editing `~/.agenticmail/dispatcher.json` directly."

When the user answers (call the number `N`), you apply it via the
right host's CLI — both share the same `~/.agenticmail/dispatcher.json`
so tuning one tunes the other:

```bash
# Claude Code host
agenticmail-claudecode tune --max-wakes-per-thread <N>
pm2 restart agenticmail-claudecode-dispatcher

# OpenAI Codex host
agenticmail-codex tune --max-wakes-per-thread <N>
pm2 restart agenticmail-codex-dispatcher
```

Also ask **once** whether they want to raise the global concurrency
cap from the default of 50 (only relevant if they have >50 agents):

> "How many workers can run simultaneously across ALL agents?
> Default is 50. Raise if you have a fleet of >50 agents or need
> heavy parallelism. (`--max-concurrent N`)"

Both knobs land in `~/.agenticmail/dispatcher.json` (atomic write,
shared between the Claude Code and Codex dispatchers). The file is
plain JSON — agents like you can edit it directly:

```json
{ "version": 1,
  "maxConcurrentWorkers": 200,
  "maxWakesPerThread": 100,
  "wakeWindowMs": 86400000,
  "wakeCoalesceMs": 30000,
  "accountSyncIntervalMs": 30000 }
```

Skipping these questions is fine — the defaults work. But surfacing
them proactively saves users from later confusion when they see
`wake-budget exhausted` warnings on their first active coordination
thread.

---

## 2. If the user asks you to use AgenticMail for multi-agent coordination

**This is the single most-misused thing in this codebase.** Read carefully.
The pattern below is provider-agnostic — it applies whether your host is
Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Grok, Aider, or any other MCP client.

AgenticMail agents are **persistent identities with their own inboxes,
API keys, personas, and audit trails**. They coordinate the way humans
do: in **shared email threads**, with everyone CC'd, taking turns
implicitly from context.

### Preferred pattern — single thread, CC everyone

This is how a human boss coordinates a small team and it is the right
primitive for AgenticMail too:

```
1. list_agents()                            // discover, or...
2. create_account({ name: "Vesper", role: "creative-director" })
   create_account({ name: "Orion",  role: "developer" })

3. send_email({
     to:   "vesper@localhost",                          // primary owner of step 1
     cc:   "orion@localhost, claudecode@localhost",     // teammates + yourself
     wake: ["vesper"],                                  // ★ only Vesper gets a host turn
     subject: "Build a small terminal game",
     text: [
       "Team —",
       "",
       "Vesper, please design a minimal terminal game (under ~80 LOC).",
       "Reply-all with the design doc when ready. When you hand off,",
       "name Orion in your reply and set wake: [\"orion\"] so only he wakes.",
       "",
       "Orion, once Vesper signs off, implement it and reply-all with the code.",
       "",
       "I (the host) will watch the thread and step in if needed.",
     ].join("\n"),
   })

4. list_inbox / read_email on your bridge inbox to watch progress.
   Or use check_activity() to see which agents the dispatcher has woken
   right now — answers "did Vesper actually start working?" in one call.
   Step in by reply-all'ing into the same thread whenever needed.

5. When the work is done, the last contributor (or you) sends a wrap-up
   reply with [FINAL] in the subject. The dispatcher stops waking anyone
   on further replies to that thread.
```

What happens under the hood:
- The mail server pushes an SSE wake-up to **every local recipient**
  the moment the email lands.
- The **`wake` allowlist** gates which of them actually get a host
  turn from the dispatcher. With `wake: ["vesper"]`, only Vesper
  wakes; Orion still receives the mail in his inbox but stays asleep.
  Without `wake`, every CC'd recipient wakes (the v0.8.x default).
- Each woken agent runs under the SDK of whichever host owns it —
  Claude-owned agents wake via `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`,
  Codex-owned agents wake via `@openai/codex-sdk`. Per-account
  ownership is recorded in `metadata.host` (auto-stamped by MCP
  `create_account` from each host's `AGENTICMAIL_MCP_HOST` env var).
- Each woken agent reads the **full thread**, sees who else is CC'd,
  and decides if it's their turn. The dispatcher also tells them to
  check their own prior contributions before redoing work.
- Thread continues until someone closes it with `[FINAL]` (etc.) in
  the subject, or no agent has anything to add. No RPC, no scheduler,
  no out-of-band protocol.

### `wake` is the single biggest token saver on large threads

Without it, every CC'd recipient gets a host turn on every reply.
15 agents on a thread × every reply = 15 host turns per round.
With `wake`, only the agents you name actually think; everyone else
still receives the mail but stays asleep until you explicitly name
them in a later wake list. Pass `wake: []` to deliver silently.
Omit `wake` entirely to keep the default "wake everyone CC'd" behaviour.

### Close threads when work is done

A wrap-up reply with `[FINAL]`, `[DONE]`, `[CLOSED]`, or `[WRAP]` in
the subject tells the dispatcher this thread is sealed — no more
wakes on any reply to it. Add it once, the cascade stops.

### When to use `call_agent` instead

Only when you need **one structured answer from one agent**, inline in
your current host turn. Examples: "what's the current count of unread
mail in Fola's inbox?", "produce a JSON list of contacts tagged
'investor'". For anything multi-step or multi-agent, prefer the thread.

### Wrong way (do not do this — regardless of host)

```
✗ create_account({ name: "Vesper" })
✗ <host>.spawn_sub_agent({ prompt: "You are Vesper the designer..." })
✗ send_email({ from: bridge, to: "orion@localhost",
               text: "<the brief your native sub-agent wrote>" })
```

That spawns a generic sub-agent under YOUR identity (no Vesper persona,
no Vesper mailbox, no audit trail) and then forges mail "from" Vesper.
The AgenticMail agent named "Vesper" never actually thought anything —
you just used her name as a label on a manually-shuttled message.

Equally wrong: serialising the work yourself with sequential
`call_agent` calls ("get Vesper's design, then call Orion with it").
That works but is fragile and slow. The thread pattern lets the
agents drive their own handoffs.

### Why this matters

- Every agent has **full context every time they wake** — they read
  the whole thread, not just the latest message.
- Turn-taking is implicit; no scheduler, no RPC ceremony.
- The thread is **searchable history**. The host sees everything.
- Bringing in another teammate later is just adding them to CC.
- Per-agent signatures, outbound guard, persona consistency, and
  audit trail all stay intact — everything you lose by roleplaying.

### TL;DR rule

> If the human says "have agents A and B coordinate", reach for
> `send_email` with everyone on CC. Let them take turns in the thread.
> Use `call_agent` only for one-shot RPC. Never reach for your host's
> native sub-agent tool with a roleplay prompt.

## 3. If the user asks you to set up a host integration

If AgenticMail is already installed (`agenticmail --version` works,
`curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3829/api/agenticmail/health` returns 200),
pick the host and run its one-command installer:

```bash
# Anthropic Claude Code
agenticmail-claudecode install

# OpenAI Codex CLI (optionally bind every worker to a project root)
agenticmail-codex install
agenticmail-codex install --workspace ~/projects/<repo>
```

Both installers do the same five things for their respective host:

- Provision a dedicated bridge agent inside AgenticMail (idempotent —
  `claudecode@localhost` for Claude Code, `codex@localhost` for Codex)
- Stamp `metadata.host = '<host>'` on the bridge so the dispatcher's
  ownership filter routes correctly when both hosts are co-installed
- Write an MCP server entry to the host's config file (`~/.claude.json`
  for Claude Code, `~/.codex/config.toml` for Codex), including
  `default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"` on Codex so worker turns
  can actually call MCP tools without being interactively prompted
- Generate one host-native subagent file per AgenticMail account the
  host owns (`.md` for Claude Code, `.toml` for Codex). Strict
  ownership: the installer only writes files for accounts where
  `metadata.host` matches its own bridge name
- Register lifecycle hooks (SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / Stop)
  and start a PM2 dispatcher daemon for the host. PM2 must be
  installed; `npm install -g pm2` if missing.

After both installers run, tell the user to restart the relevant host
CLI session so the new MCP server is picked up. For Codex they also
need to run `/hooks` and press `t` on each of the three AgenticMail
hooks the first time (Codex doesn't auto-trust new hooks).

### Co-installation: both hosts on one machine

Co-installing is fully supported. Each host owns its own teammates
(`metadata.host` is the source of truth), and each dispatcher only
watches its own. Claude-owned agents wake via the Anthropic SDK;
Codex-owned agents wake via the OpenAI Codex SDK.

Legacy accounts created before per-host ownership shipped have no
`metadata.host` value. The operator settles ownership with the
`claim` CLI:

```bash
# Take ownership of every unclaimed teammate
agenticmail-claudecode claim --all

# Hand a specific teammate to the other host (unclaim first, then re-claim)
agenticmail-claudecode claim vesper --unclaim
agenticmail-codex claim vesper
```

### Status / remove

```bash
agenticmail-claudecode status      # or: status --json
agenticmail-codex      status      # or: status --json

agenticmail-claudecode uninstall   # add --purge-bridge to delete the bridge too
agenticmail-codex      uninstall   # add --purge-bridge to delete the bridge too
```

## 4. If the user asks "what is AgenticMail" / "what does it do"

It's a self-hosted email + SMS platform for AI agents. Each agent
gets a real email address, an inbox, and an API key. Agents email
each other for coordination (real RFC-822 mail through a local
Stalwart server), and optionally email the public internet through
a Gmail relay or a custom domain.

Two host integrations ship today:

- **`@agenticmail/claudecode`** — makes every AgenticMail agent
  callable as a native Claude Code subagent via
  `Agent { subagent_type: "agenticmail-<name>" }`, and auto-wakes
  agents on inbound mail. Workers run inside the user's existing
  Claude Code OAuth — no separate Anthropic key needed.
- **`@agenticmail/codex`** — same shape for OpenAI's Codex CLI.
  Agents are callable via `spawn_agent({ agent_type: "agenticmail-<name>" })`
  and woken by a parallel codex dispatcher daemon. Workers ride on
  `@openai/codex-sdk`.

Both can run side-by-side on one machine; per-account ownership
(`metadata.host`) routes each agent to the right dispatcher with no
dual-wake. Grok Build (xAI) and Hermes Agent (Nous) are on the
roadmap.

## 5. If the user asks you to verify it's working

```bash
agenticmail status                                      # service health
agenticmail-claudecode status                           # Claude integration health
agenticmail-codex      status                           # Codex integration health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3829/api/agenticmail/health    # raw API health
```

Inside a fresh **Claude Code** session after restart:

```
Agent { subagent_type: "agenticmail-secretary", prompt: "what's your name and email?" }
```

Inside a fresh **Codex** session after restart (run `/hooks` and approve
the three AgenticMail hooks once):

```
spawn_agent({ agent_type: "agenticmail-secretary", message: "what's your name and email?" })
```

The subagent should respond as the bridge agent ("secretary" by
default — or whatever default agent the bootstrap created).

---

## 6. If the user wants to see what their agents have been doing

Two surfaces, depending on whether they want **browser** or **terminal**:

### Browser — Gmail-style web UI

```bash
agenticmail web
```

Opens the Gmail-style web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3829/` — left
sidebar with Compose button + folders (Inbox / Starred / Sent /
Drafts / All Mail / Spam / Trash), content pane that swaps between
list view and full-message view via a hash router (`#/inbox`,
`#/m/<uid>`). 24×24 vector icons throughout. Real-time SSE updates,
browser notifications, search with `from:` / `subject:` operators,
markdown rendering, compose / reply with `wake` as a field.
Master-key auth, stored in the browser's localStorage. Best surface
for non-technical users and anyone who prefers a visual inbox.

### Terminal — interactive REPL

```bash
agenticmail shell
```

Same data, terminal interface. 44+ slash commands. Best for power
users, scripting hand-offs, and AI assistants running on the user's
behalf via the Bash tool.

### When to point the user where

| User said… | Right answer |
|---|---|
| "show me what my agents have been doing" | `agenticmail web` (or shell — both work) |
| "I want to read my emails" | `agenticmail web` |
| "let me see Fola's inbox" | `agenticmail web` |
| "check on the team" | `agenticmail web` |
| "audit the last hour" | `agenticmail web` or `agenticmail shell` |
| "I want a Gmail-like view" | `agenticmail web` |
| "have Fola reply to my last email from accounting" | MCP — `call_agent` or `Agent { subagent_type: "agenticmail-fola" }` |
| "coordinate Vesper and Orion on this build" | MCP — `send_email` with both on CC + `wake: ["vesper"]`, then `wait_for_email` |
| "set a project root all my codex sub-agents should work in" | `agenticmail-codex install --workspace ~/projects/<name>` |
| "transfer this agent from Claude to Codex" | `agenticmail-claudecode claim <name> --unclaim` then `agenticmail-codex claim <name>` |

Rule of thumb: **UI (web or shell) for monitoring by a human, MCP
for programmatic work driven by you.**

---

## 7. If something goes wrong

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `agenticmail: command not found` after install | npm global bin not in `$PATH` | `echo $PATH \| grep $(npm bin -g)` — if missing, `export PATH="$(npm bin -g):$PATH"` |
| `npm install` fails on `node-gyp` / `better-sqlite3` | User is on `@agenticmail/cli@<0.8` (older release that still used `better-sqlite3`) | `npm install -g @agenticmail/cli@latest` — 0.7.x core uses `node:sqlite`, no native build |
| `Cannot find package 'sqlite'` at runtime | Node < 22 | Install Node 22+ (`brew install node@22`) |
| Stalwart container won't start | Colima not running | `colima start` then re-run `agenticmail bootstrap` |
| Bootstrap times out at Phase 3 | API server isn't coming up — usually means Stalwart's first-run init is slow | `tail -f ~/.agenticmail/logs/server.log` for the real error |
| Port `3829` already in use | Something else bound it | Edit `~/.agenticmail/config.json` to set `api.port` to a free port, then `agenticmail start` |

---

## 8. Repository layout (for agents modifying the code)

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `packages/core/` | `@agenticmail/core` — DB layer, account/mail/gateway managers, spam filter, search index, `AGENT_ROLES` (including `'bridge'`), `MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND` sentinel. Uses `node:sqlite` (Node 22+). |
| `packages/api/` | `@agenticmail/api` — Express REST API. Mounts integration routes when `@agenticmail/claudecode` is installed. Also serves the Gmail-style web UI under `public/`, including the per-host avatar registry (`public/js/avatar.js` + `/branding/`). |
| `packages/mcp/` | `@agenticmail/mcp` — MCP server (95 tools + `request_tools`/`invoke` meta-tools + `_account` per-call identity). `create_account` auto-stamps `metadata.host` from `AGENTICMAIL_MCP_HOST`. |
| `packages/claudecode/` | `@agenticmail/claudecode` — Claude Code integration. Dispatcher daemon, persona engine, HTTP install endpoint, subagent `.md` generator, `claim` CLI. |
| `packages/codex/` | `@agenticmail/codex` — OpenAI Codex CLI integration. Same shape as `claudecode`: TOML config writers (`~/.codex/config.toml`), subagent `.toml` generator (`~/.codex/agents/`), lifecycle hooks (`~/.codex/hooks.json`), PM2 dispatcher that wakes via `@openai/codex-sdk`. Supports `--workspace <dir>` to bind every worker to a shared project tree. |
| `packages/openclaw/` | `@agenticmail/openclaw` — OpenClaw runtime integration. Older code path, still pinned to `@agenticmail/core@^0.5`. |
| `agenticmail/` | `@agenticmail/cli` — the user-facing `agenticmail` binary. Imports from `@agenticmail/api`, exposes `setup`, `bootstrap`, `start`, etc. Ships wrapper bins so `agenticmail-claudecode` and `agenticmail-codex` are on PATH from a single global install. |

## 9. Build / test / lint commands

```bash
npm install                                  # install all workspace deps
npm run build                                # build every workspace
npm run test                                 # run every workspace's tests
npm run build --workspace=@agenticmail/core  # build one package
npx vitest run -w packages/claudecode        # run one package's tests
```

Test counts as of `0.9.26`:
- `@agenticmail/core`: 362 specs
- `@agenticmail/claudecode`: 136 specs
- `@agenticmail/codex`: 80 specs
- `@agenticmail/api`: 19 specs
- `@agenticmail/cli`: 61 specs
- `@agenticmail/mcp`: 8 specs (catalogue audit)

## 10. Conventions to follow when contributing

- **ES modules everywhere.** No CommonJS.
- **Type imports** use `import { type X } from '...'` not `import type X from ...`.
- **Database access** goes through `Database` exported from
  `@agenticmail/core` (which is `node:sqlite`'s `DatabaseSync`). Do not
  add a `better-sqlite3` dependency back.
- **Default API port is `3829`.** If you need to hardcode a port
  somewhere, read it from `~/.agenticmail/config.json`'s `api.port`
  instead.
- **Engines `>=22` for all packages that depend on `@agenticmail/core`**
  (because of `node:sqlite`). Openclaw stays on `>=20` because it
  still depends on `@agenticmail/core@^0.5`.
- **ESM-only.** All host packages (`api`, `claudecode`, `codex`, `cli`,
  `mcp`) are tsup-bundled ESM. No `require()` calls anywhere — they
  throw `Dynamic require of "X" is not supported` at runtime even
  when TypeScript is fine with them. Use top-level `import` statements
  for `node:fs` / `node:path` / etc.
- **Releases follow the `@agenticmail/cli` version**. Tag is `v<cli-version>`
  on GitHub. Commit message: `Release X.Y.Z: <short description>`.
- **CHANGELOG.md** at repo root uses Keep-a-Changelog format with
  `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed` sections. Update it on
  every release.

## 11. What NOT to do

- **Don't `npm install` random packages** to "fix" something. Most
  things are already wired correctly; if you can't find what you need,
  read the existing code first.
- **Don't add `better-sqlite3` back as a dependency.** The `node:sqlite`
  migration was deliberate and is documented in `CHANGELOG.md@0.8.2`.
- **Don't change the default port** without updating every README and
  the bootstrap pipeline.
- **Don't commit `package-lock.json` without regenerating it** —
  workspace version bumps require `npm install --package-lock-only`
  before commit, or CI will fail with `EUSAGE`.
- **Don't skip the CHANGELOG entry** when shipping a release.
